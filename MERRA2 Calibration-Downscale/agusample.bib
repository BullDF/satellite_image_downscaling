	abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

	abstract = {The demand for high-resolution information on climate change is critical for accurate projections and decision-making. Presently, this need is addressed through high-resolution climate models or downscaling. High-resolution models are computationally demanding and creating ensemble simulations with them is typically prohibitively expensive. Downscaling methods are more affordable but are typically limited to small regions. This study proposes the use of existing AI-based numerical weather prediction systems (AI-NWP) to perform global downscaling of climate information from low-resolution climate models. Our results demonstrate that AI-NWP initalized from low-resolution initial conditions can develop detailed forecasts closely resembling the resolution of the training data using a one day lead time. We constructed year-long atmospheric fields using AI-NWP forecasts initialized from smoothed ERA5 and low-resolution CMIP6 models. Our analysis for 2-metre temperature indicates that AI-NWP can generate high-quality, long-term datasets and potentially perform bias correction, bringing climate model outputs closer to observed data. The study highlights the potential for off-the-shelf AI-NWP to enhance climate data downscaling, offering a simple and computationally efficient alternative to traditional downscaling techniques. The downscaled data can be used either directly for localized climate information or as boundary conditions for further dynamical downscaling.},

	abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides daily global coverage, but the 10 km resolution of its aerosol optical depth (AOD) product is not suitable for studying spatial variability of aerosols in urban areas. Recently, a new Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm was developed for MODIS which provides AOD at 1 km resolution. Using MAIAC data, the relationship between MAIAC AOD and PM2.5 as measured by the 27 EPA ground monitoring stations was investigated. These results were also compared to conventional MODIS 10 km AOD retrievals (MOD04) for the same days and locations. The coefficients of determination for MOD04 and for MAIAC are R2 =0.45 and 0.50 respectively, suggested that AOD is a reasonably good proxy for PM2.5 ground concentrations. Finally, we studied the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD at the intra-urban scale (≤10 km) in Boston. The fine resolution results indicated spatial variability in particle concentration at a sub-10 kilometer scale. A local analysis for the Boston area showed that the AOD-PM2.5 relationship does not depend on relative humidity and air temperatures below {\textasciitilde}7 °C. The correlation improves for temperatures above 7–16 °C. We found no dependence on the boundary layer height except when the former was in the range 250–500 m. Finally, we apply a mixed effects model approach to MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from MODIS to predict PM2.5 concentrations within the greater Boston area. With this approach we can control for the inherent day-to-day variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, which depends on time-varying parameters such as particle optical properties, vertical and diurnal concentration profiles and ground surface reflectance. Our results show that the model-predicted PM2.5 mass concentrations are highly correlated with the actual observations (out-of-sample R2 of 0.86). Therefore, adjustment for the daily variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship provides a means for obtaining spatially-resolved PM2.5 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Statistical downscaling with affective variables which stem from screening techniques is required as part of studies project climate conditions in the future, based on climate change situation. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for downscaling has become very common in the recent decade. However, deep learning methods are the new generation of AI methods that are gaining more attention due to better training compared to older generations. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the novel deep learning methods which was used to downscale daily precipitation and temperature (predictand) data in this study. To this end, large-scale climate variables (predictor) were extracted from Coupled Model Inter Comparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) General Circulation Models (GCMs) for Tabriz synoptic stations in the northwest of Iran. To diminish the dimension of variables, eliminate redundant information and obtain the most accurate downscaling and projection results, predictor screening methods must be employed. Here in this study Random Forest (RF) and Mutual Information (MI) as the two non-linear screening methods were used for screening purpose predictors. Then, the dominant predictors fed into the CNN downscaling model and Results of the study in terms of evaluation criteria denotes that not only does the performance of CNN-based downscaling surpass ANN, but also the conjunction with screening methods also improves the efficiency. Therefore, models that have not benefited from predictor screening methods, performed weakly.},

Using Machine Learning (ML) approach, this research aims to improve the estimation of grid-wise PM2.5, a criteria pollutant, by reducing systematic bias from speciation provided by MERRA-from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). The ML model was trained using various meteorological parameters and aerosol species simulated by MERRA-2 and ground measurements from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality system stations. The ML approach significantly improved performance and reduced mean bias in the 0–10 μg m−3 range. We also used the Random Forest ML model for each EPA region using 1 year of collocated data sets. The resulting ML models for each EPA region were validated, and the aggregate data set has a Spearman Rank correlation (SR) of 0.73 (RMSE = 4.8 μg m−3) and 0.69 (RMSE = 5.8 μg m−3) for training and testing, respectively. The SR (and RMSE in μg m−3) increased to 0.81 (3.9), 0.89 (1.6), and 0.90 (1.1) for daily, monthly, and yearly averages, respectively. The results from the initial implementation of the ML model for the global region are encouraging. Still, they require more research and development to overcome challenges associated with data gaps in many parts of the world.},

	abstract = {Aerosols have adverse health effects and play a significant role in the climate as well. The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) provides Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at high temporal (daily) and spatial (1 km) resolution, making it particularly useful to infer and characterize spatiotemporal variability of aerosols at a fine spatial scale for exposure assessment and health studies. However, clouds and conditions of high surface reflectance result in a significant proportion of missing MAIAC AOD. To fill these gaps, we present an imputation approach using deep learning with downscaling. Using a baseline autoencoder, we leverage residual connections in deep neural networks to boost learning and parameter sharing to reduce overfitting, and conduct bagging to reduce error variance in the imputations. Downscaled through a similar auto-encoder based deep residual network, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) data were introduced to the network as an important gap-filling feature that varies in space to be used for missingness imputations. Imputing weekly MAIAC AOD from 2000 to 2016 over California, a state with considerable geographic heterogeneity, our full (non-full) residual network achieved mean R2 = 0.94 (0.86) [RMSE = 0.007 (0.01)] in an independent test, showing considerably better performance than a regular neural network or non-linear generalized additive model (mean R2 = 0.78–0.81; mean RMSE = 0.013–0.015). The adjusted imputed as well as combined imputed and observed MAIAC AOD showed strong correlation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD (R = 0.83; R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.04). Our results show that we can generate reliable imputations of missing AOD through a deep learning approach, having important downstream air quality modeling applications.},

This study selected the Yellow River Basin as its research area and assessed multiple variables, including the land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, aspect, longitude, and latitude. We constructed three downscaling models, namely, ET, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and applied a stacking ensemble learning algorithm to integrate these three models. Through this approach, ERA5-Land reanalysis air temperature data were successfully downscaled from a spatial resolution of 0.1° to 1 km, and the downscaled results were validated using observed data from meteorological stations. The results indicate that the stacking ensemble model significantly outperforms the three independent machine learning models. The integrated model, combined with the selected set of multiple variables, provides a feasible approach for downsizing ERA5 air temperature data. The stacking ensemble model not only effectively enhances the spatial resolution of ERA5 reanalysis air temperature data but also improves downscaled results to a certain extent. The downscaled air temperature data exhibit richer spatial texture information, better revealing spatial variations in air temperature within the same land class. This research outcome provides robust technical support for obtaining high-resolution air temperature data in meteorologically sparse or topographically complex regions, contributing significantly to climate, ecosystem, and sustainable development research.},

	abstract = {Background: Estimating the burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in ambient air requires knowledge of both the shape and magnitude of the relative
risk (RR) function. However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the
mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places
in the world is lacking.Objective: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes
of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed
RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can
be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children \&lt; 5 years
of age.Methods: We fit an integrated exposure–response (IER) model by integrating available
RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke,
household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted
to estimated annual PM2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population
attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient
PM2.5 concentrations.Results: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms
previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure
varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, \&lt; 1 to 21 for COPD,
\&lt; 1 to 25 for LC, and \&lt; 1 to 38 for ALRI.Conclusions: We developed a fine particulate mass–based RR model that covered the
global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types
that generate emissions of particulate matter. The model can be updated as new RR
information becomes available.Citation: Burnett RT, Pope CA III, Ezzati M, Olives C, Lim SS, Mehta S, Shin HH, Singh

	abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA’s terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of source resolved atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations at high resolutions using chemical transport models (CTMs) require expensive CTM simulations and development of high-resolution emissions inventories. We use multiple machine learning (ML) approaches to downscale coarse-resolution (36 × 36 km2) CTM predictions to 1 × 1 km2 spatial resolution. ML predictions include concentrations of the major chemical components of PM2.5 and the contributions of its major emissions sources. Inputs for the ML models include 36 × 36 km2 source resolved CTM predicted concentrations of all PM2.5 components, meteorological data, and several land-use (LU) variables. The output of our ML models is the 1 × 1 km2 source-resolved concentrations of all major PM2.5 components in southwestern Pennsylvania (5184 km2 domain) during February and July 2017. Models were trained and validated using 1 × 1 km2 resolution source- and species-resolved CTM predictions of PM2.5 from recent complementary studies. The best overall performance was found using a random forest (RF) model, where species and source resolved PM2.5 concentrations were reproduced with low normalized mean bias ({\textbar}NMB{\textbar} {\textless} 0.01). The downscaling model captures the spatial distribution of PM2.5 both by component and source, with some discrepancies when predicting the plumes of large point sources that have long-range impacts. In a test of generalizability to unknown domains, the model differentiates well between areas that are primarily urban, rural, or industrial but faces challenges with the reproduction of the effects of large point sources of PM2.5 when entire quadrants are removed from the training data. The results represent a proof of concept for downscaling lowresolution CTM predictions using native high-resolution CTM predictions in training.},

We apply stringent editing to select the highest quality elevations, and use these GCPs to characterize and quantify spatially varying elevation biases in Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). In this paper, we present an evaluation of the soon to be released Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010). Elevation biases and error statistics have been analyzed as a function of land cover and relief. The GMTED2010 products are a large improvement over previous sources of elevation data at comparable resolutions. RMSEs for all products and terrain conditions are below 7 m and typically are about 4 m. The GMTED2010 products are biased upward with respect to the ICESat GCPs on average by approximately 3 m.},

	abstract = {High altitude stations are often emphasized as free tropospheric measuring sites but they remain influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) air masses due to convective transport processes. The local and meso-scale topographical features around the station are involved in the convective boundary layer development and in the formation of thermally induced winds leading to ABL air lifting. The station altitude alone is not a sufficient parameter to characterize the ABL influence. In this study, a topography analysis is performed allowing calculation of a newly defined index called ABL-TopoIndex. The ABL-TopoIndex is constructed in order to correlate with the ABL influence at the high altitude stations and long-term aerosol time series are used to assess its validity. Topography data from the global digital elevation model GTopo30 were used to calculate five parameters for 43 high and 3 middle altitude stations situated on five continents. The geometric mean of these five parameters determines a topography based index called ABL-TopoIndex, which can be used to rank the high altitude stations as a function of the ABL influence. To construct the ABL-TopoIndex, we rely on the criteria that the ABL influence will be low if the station is one of the highest points in the mountainous massif, if there is a large altitude difference between the station and the valleys or high plains, if the slopes around the station are steep, and finally if the inverse drainage basin potentially reflecting the source area for thermally lifted pollutants to reach the site is small. All stations on volcanic islands exhibit a low ABL-TopoIndex, whereas stations in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau have high ABL-TopoIndex values. Spearman's rank correlation between aerosol optical properties and number concentration from 28 stations and the ABL-TopoIndex, the altitude and the latitude are used to validate this topographical approach. Statistically significant (SS) correlations are found between the 5th and 50th percentiles of all aerosol parameters and the ABL-TopoIndex, whereas no SS correlation is found with the station altitude. The diurnal cycles of aerosol parameters seem to be best explained by the station latitude although a SS correlation is found between the amplitude of the diurnal cycles of the absorption coefficient and the ABL-TopoIndex.},

The GCM used was the U.K. Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre's coupled ocean/atmosphere model (HadCM2) forced by combined CO2 and sulfate aerosol changes. Climate model results for 1980–1999 (present) and 2080–2099 (future) were used, for six regions across the United States. The downscaling methods compared were different weather generator techniques (the standard “WGEN” method, and a method based on spell-length durations), two different methods using grid point vorticity data as an atmospheric predictor variable (B-Circ and C-Circ), and two variations of an artificial neural network (ANN) transfer function technique using circulation data and circulation plus temperature data as predictor variables. Comparisons of results were facilitated by using standard sets of observed and GCM-derived predictor variables and by using a standard suite of diagnostic statistics. Significant differences in the level of skill were found among the downscaling methods. The weather generation techniques, which are able to fit a number of daily precipitation statistics exactly, yielded the smallest differences between observed and simulated daily precipitation. The ANN methods performed poorly because of a failure to simulate wet-day occurrence statistics adequately. Changes in precipitation between the present and future scenarios produced by the statistical downscaling methods were generally smaller than those produced directly by the GCM. Changes in daily precipitation produced by the GCM between 1980–1999 and 2080–2099 were therefore judged not to be due primarily to changes in atmospheric circulation. In the light of these results and detailed model comparisons, suggestions for future research and model refinements are presented.},

With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques (in particular convolutional neural networks, CNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for statistical downscaling due to their ability to learn spatial features from huge spatiotemporal datasets. However, existing studies are based on complex models, applied to particular case studies and using simple validation frameworks, which makes a proper assessment of the (possible) added value offered by these techniques difficult. As a result, these models are usually seen as black boxes, generating distrust among the climate community, particularly in climate change applications.

 In this paper we undertake a comprehensive assessment of deep learning techniques for continental-scale statistical downscaling, building on the VALUE validation framework. In particular, different CNN models of increasing complexity are applied to downscale temperature and precipitation over Europe, comparing them with a few standard benchmark methods from VALUE (linear and generalized linear models) which have been traditionally used for this purpose. Besides analyzing the adequacy of different components and topologies, we also focus on their extrapolation capability, a critical point for their potential application in climate change studies. To do this, we use a warm test period as a surrogate for possible future climate conditions.

 Our results show that, while the added value of CNNs is mostly limited to the reproduction of extremes for temperature, these techniques do outperform the classic ones in the case of precipitation for most aspects considered. This overall good performance, together with the fact that they can be suitably applied to large regions (e.g., continents) without worrying about the spatial features being considered as predictors, can foster the use of statistical approaches in international initiatives such as Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).},

	abstract = {This study introduces and validates an artificial intelligence (AI)–based downscaling method for Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) in the northwest of Iran, utilizing PERSSIAN-CDR data and MODIS-derived drought-dependent variables. The correlation between SPI and two drought-dependent variables at a spatial resolution of 0.25° from 2000 to 2015 served as the basis for predicting SPI values at a finer spatial resolution of 0.05° for the period spanning 2016 to 2021. Shallow AI models (Support Vector Regression, Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System, Feedforward Neural Network) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning method are employed for downscaling, followed by an ensemble post-processing technique for shallow AI models. Validation against rain gauge data indicates that all methods improve SPI simulation compared to PERSIANN-CDR products. The ensemble technique excels by 20\% and 25\% in the training and test phases, respectively, achieving the mean Determination Coefficient (DC) score of 0.67 in the validation phase. Results suggest that the deep learning LSTM method is less suitable for limited observed data compared to ensemble techniques. Additionally, the proposed methodology successfully detects approximately 80\% of drought conditions. Notably, SPI-6 outperforms other temporal scales. This study advances the understanding of AI-driven downscaling for SPI, emphasizing the efficacy of ensemble approaches and providing valuable insights for regions with limited observational data.},

As a consequence of posterior collapse, the latent variables extracted by the encoder in VAE preserve less information from the input data and thus fail to produce meaningful representations as input to the reconstruction process in the decoder. While this phenomenon has been an actively addressed topic related to VAE performance, the theory for posterior collapse remains underdeveloped, especially beyond the standard VAE. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of posterior collapse to two important and prevalent yet less studied classes of VAE: conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE. Specifically, via a non-trivial theoretical analysis of linear conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE with two levels of latent, we prove that the cause of posterior collapses in these models includes the correlation between the input and output of the conditional VAE and the effect of learnable encoder variance in the hierarchical VAE. We empirically validate our theoretical findings for linear conditional and hierarchical VAE and demonstrate that these results are also predictive for non-linear cases with extensive experiments.},

Effective downscaling methods that provide localized insights are crucial for this target. Traditional approaches, including computationally-demanding regional dynamical models or statistical downscaling frameworks, are often susceptible to the influence of downscaling uncertainty. Here, we address these limitations by introducing a diffusion probabilistic downscaling model (DPDM) into the meteorological field. This model can efficiently transform data from 1° to 0.1° resolution. Compared with deterministic downscaling schemes, it not only has more accurate local details, but also can generate a large number of ensemble members based on probability distribution sampling to evaluate the uncertainty of downscaling. Additionally, we apply the model to generate a 180-year dataset of monthly surface variables in East Asia, offering a more detailed perspective for understanding local scale climate change over the past centuries.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand. Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that can accommodates very high scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods, the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result. These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to \$64{\textbackslash}times\$) and highlight the advantages of the framework with a comprehensive comparison with commonly used and most recent downscaling methods, including area-to-point (ATP) kriging, deep image prior (DIP), enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), physics-informed resolution-enhancing GAN (PhIRE GAN), and an efficient diffusion model for remote sensing image super-resolution (EDiffSR).},
